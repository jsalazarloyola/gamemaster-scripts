			<p><em>The problem</em>: In my Pathfinder group, the players are tasked with recruiting noobs to the cause. Rather than letting them dream up the commoners with the potential they needed, I wrote a script to make their recruits a bit more random while still giving them some choice in how to train them.</p>
			<p><em>Instructions</em>: Plug in how many commoners you want, and you'll get back a stat block, as well as some classes that work for them.</p>
